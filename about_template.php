							We are a private, co-educational, senior secondary school serving higher secondary students in Arts, Science and Commerce, located in Rampur, Kamrup(R).
						</p>

							Trident Academy believes in nurturing young students to the highest level of global leadership in all fields. Our education system embraces the fact that every student comes to the Trident Academy with his or her own hopes and aspirations. To meet these needs, we believe, it is important to encourage the pursuit of academic endeavour within a caring environment that promotes each studentâ€™s ability and learning style. We strive to provide the best learning environment for our students and ensure the overall development.

				Our Philosophy
			</div>
			<div class="info text-center">
				<p class="">
					Our region is in immense need of more educational institutes to cater to the diverse need of the student community. There are numerous talented students with immense scholarly potential who have to travel to nearby cities away from their homes to fulfill their academic ambitions. Unavailability of academic institutions in the area makes it difficult for them to achieve their academic goals. Driven with a philanthropic vision, and keeping in mind the needs of the student community, we believe in bringing the academic institutes closer to their homes in Rampur. The founders of Trident Academy strongly believe in harnessing the power of knowledge by providing support in both academics and co-curricular activities, while contributing to the holistic development of our student. We believe every student should be inspired and challenged to reach their full potential. In this vein, the Junior College will cater to the needs of the students in all the three streams of study, i.e., Arts, Science and Commerce.
